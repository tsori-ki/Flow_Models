## Current Status
- Basic implementation is in place
- Need to verify and complete all required visualizations
- Need to ensure model architectures match requirements exactly
- Need to implement proper evaluation metrics

## Known Issues
1. Need to verify model architectures match requirements
2. Need to implement all required visualizations
3. Need to add proper evaluation metrics
4. Need to ensure reproducible training process
